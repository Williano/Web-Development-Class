Jerry Jones||Strength Conditioning Tips||images/blog/Strength_Conditioning_Tips.jpg||Cardio is so overrated - especially as you get over 40. Converting fat to muscle using strength conditioning is where its at!! And focusing on upper body is far more important than the lower body - especially the abdominal area.  Belly fat has always been a problem for most of us and focusing on upper body - back/ triceps abdominal will help you so much. The Total Gym is a great strength conditioning  tool and I hope all of you will get a chance to try it out soon.||05-04-2021
